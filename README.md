This is the tenth independent project (Ruby, Week 4 & 5) assigned by Epicodus designed to be a two-part series. This first week is assessing the implementation of Ruby on Rails, creating a database to include a one-to-many relationship between 'Products' and 'Reviews.' The second week is assessing the implementation of user authentication and authorization. The core emphases are incorporating scopes, validations, callbacks, seeding, and flash messages to the project.

For a visual relationship representation of the database:
