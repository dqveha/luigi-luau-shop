This is the tenth independent project (Ruby, Week 4) assigned by Epicodus that will be broken up into two weeks. This first week is assessing the implementation of Ruby on Rails, creating a database to include a one-to-many relationship between 'Products' and 'Reviews.' The main emphases are incorporating scopes, validations, callbacks, seeding, and flash messages to the project.

For a visual relationship representation of the database:
