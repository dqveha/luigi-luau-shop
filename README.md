<!-- Bug

1. Unable to get before_save to work with Review class; tested on record store practice, and does not work as well for some reason. -->

<!--
Landing Page

The landing page should include basic information about the company and should allow users to easily navigate to other areas of the site. This page should also include the three most recently added products and the product with the most reviews. See more information in the Scopes section below.
Products

The site needs to include a products section with a list of the tasty products that Mario sells. Each product should be clickable with a detail view.

    Users should be able to add, update and delete new products. Don't worry about user authentication. Assume everyone who visits the site is an admin for now.
    Users should be able to click an individual product to see its detail page. (You will not be expected to show the product's average rating. That's included in the further exploration section.)
    Users should be able to add a review to a product.

Scopes

Your site should use scopes to display the following information on the site:

    The product with the most reviews.
    The three most recently added products.
    All products made in the USA for buyers that want to buy local products.

Validations

Your site should include validations for the following:

    All fields should be filled out, including rating.
    Rating can only be an integer between 1 and 5.

Seeding

    Your project should include seed data for 50 products and 250 reviews. Use Faker with a loop to seed the database.

Flash Messages

    The project should include flash success and error messages for creating products and reviews.

Overall Styling

You'll be demoing this site to the CEO of Mario's Specialty Foods, so it should look presentable. -->
